-- Rules of the game: 
-- > Board is initially empty.
-- > A starting player is chosen at random. 
-- > The player who "owns" the turn may place his piece in any empty cell. 
-- > After a player plays his piece, the turn enters the end turn stage. 
-- > In the end turn stage either the game terminates (win/draw) or next player is passed ownership of the board. 
-- > A win condition for player z=(x|y) is reached when there are three z's along a row, 
--   column, diagonal, or counter-diagonal. 
-- > A draw condition is reached when 9 turns have passed and no win condition has been satisfied.

-- We can represent a board state in various ways. For example, the following would represent an empty board:
-- (1) [E,E,E,E,E,E,E,E,E]
-- (2) [[E,E,E],[E,E,E],[E,E,E]]
-- We will be using the nested representation (2).
